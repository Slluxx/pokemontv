# PokemonTV

<br/>

## NOTE (01/07/2024)

[Due to the official client and website sunsetting on March 28th 2024](https://bsky.app/profile/serebii.bsky.social/post/3kiigj55q6e2x), i will Archive this repository. I created this 3rd party client over 2 years ago and set the repository up in a way that it automatically updates itself. Since then, the API branch has made over 24.650 Commits! Quite insane that it still worked after all this time without me having to fix things.
However the time has come to shut down the service. May someone else carry on and create something even better. Thank you!

Unofficial 3rd party PokemonTV website / client which supports a number of devices. Binarys are build for the Nintendo Switch. Content is fetched from the official API.


### Why?

PokemonTV exists on a number of devices but not on all. If your device has a webbrowser, you can just go to [https://slluxx.github.io/pokemontv/](https://slluxx.github.io/pokemontv/) and watch the current content online.

I had to work with the API because some browsers don't support displaying the official website (mainly the Nintendo Switch).

### But a Nintendo Switch client already exists?

Yes, thats true. But people with a banned console or those who use 90DNS to stay hidden from nintendo have no way of watching the content. 


### How does it work?

The [API branch](https://github.com/Slluxx/pokemontv/tree/api) fetches the complete content of the API from each language and stores it because direct access to the API from a browser throws CORS errors.

The [main branch](https://github.com/Slluxx/pokemontv/tree/main) is the source-code of the website. Its build with the Vue3 framework and Bootstrap5. A GitHub Action compiles the source and pushes it to the gh-pages branch.

The [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/Slluxx/pokemontv/tree/gh-pages) is the compiled source-code of the main branch and is whats used on [the website](https://slluxx.github.io/pokemontv/).

The [switch-client branch](https://github.com/Slluxx/pokemontv/tree/switch-client) is the source-code of the homebrew for the Nintendo Switch. The homebrew just opens a simple webbrowser and loads the [the website](https://slluxx.github.io/pokemontv/).


### Notes

The website includes an iframe to the official player. Id like to get around that with a custom player (a low quality mp4 stream and a high quality m3u8 stream are exposed by the API) but the Nintendo Switchs browser is very limited and the few tests i did with it showed that i should just stop trying for a full custom solution. 

If anyone wants to add branches for binarys, i am open for PRs.
